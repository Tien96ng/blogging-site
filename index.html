    <div class="section">
      <h2> <span class="vue">Vue</span> or <span class="react">React</span>? </h2>
      <ol> 
        Assuming my understanding is correct 
        (and feel free to enlighten me if it isn't) 
        I have two questions:
        <li> With <span class="vue">Vue</span>.js readily available, is there any reason to learn <span class="react"></span>React</span>â€”other than the fact that <span class="react">React</span> came first and therefore has the bigger market share? </li>
        <li> If no such reason exists, do you expect <span class="vue">Vue</span> to take over in the future? In other words, any reason for a startup project today not to be developed in <span class="vue">Vue</span> instead of <span class="react">React</span>? </li>
      </ol>
    </div>
